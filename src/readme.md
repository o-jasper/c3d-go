This directory is for interfacing with Ethereum instances via different methods
optionally. Basically it aims to interface the same as
`github.com/ethereum/eth-go/ethpub`, but via RPC JSON instead, optionally.

(probably a waste of time..)

**NOTE** it currently gives type errors if getting data fails.
(like for instance if there is no running ethereum instance at the address)
